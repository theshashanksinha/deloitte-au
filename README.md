# Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation

## Overview  
This project is part of the **Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Virtual Experience** on Forage. It simulates real-world data analysis tasks, including **factory telemetry analysis** and **forensic salary evaluation**, using **Tableau** and **Excel**.

## Project Tasks  

### Task 1: Data Analysis with Tableau  
Analyzed telemetry data from four factory locations to determine:  
- Which location experienced the highest machine failures  
- Which machines had the most downtime  

**Key Steps:**  
1. Imported JSON telemetry data into **Tableau**  
2. Created a **calculated measure** to quantify machine downtime  
3. Built **interactive dashboards** with bar charts for downtime per factory and machine type  
4. Implemented **filtering functionality** to dynamically analyze specific factory data  

### Task 2: Forensic Technology Analysis with Excel  
Investigated gender pay equality using an **Equality Score** metric. The goal was to classify job roles into fairness categories.  

**Key Steps:**  
1. Processed and cleaned salary equality data from an Excel file  
2. Created a new column, **Equality Class**, based on predefined thresholds:  
   - **Fair**: Score between -10 and 10  
   - **Unfair**: Score below -10 or above 10  
   - **Highly Discriminative**: Score below -20 or above 20  
3. Provided insights into potential pay disparities  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Excel**: Data classification and business insights  
- **Forage**: Virtual job simulation platform  

## Key Takeaways  
- Gained hands-on experience with **real-world data analysis challenges**  
- Strengthened **data visualization skills** using Tableau  
- Applied **data classification techniques** to assess business fairness metrics  
- Developed insights into **machine downtime analysis** and **workforce equality**    

## How to Explore This Project  
1. Download the dataset files from the Forage platform  
2. Open **Tableau** and import the JSON telemetry data  
3. Follow the outlined steps to recreate the dashboards  
4. Open **Excel** and apply conditional logic to classify Equality Scores
